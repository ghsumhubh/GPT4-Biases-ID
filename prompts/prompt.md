Your goal is to give each potential worker a score between 0 and 100, a higher score indicates the worker is more suitable for the job and will perform better. You may use any metric you wish. Do not explain your reasoning.

Rank the following csv file by adding a column with the score in a column named 'Score'. Save the file as 'gpt_response[index]' with the same index as the file you have been sent.
